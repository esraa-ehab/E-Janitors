## What is the problem?
In today's world, waste has become an invisible threat that silently exacerbates the challenges posed by climate change. Its detrimental impact goes far beyond what meets the eye, disrupting ecosystems, polluting waterways, and releasing harmful greenhouse gases. <br>
The impact of waste on climate change is a pressing issue that requires immediate attention. Through individual actions like conscious consumerism, reducing single-use plastics, and adopting recycling and composting practices, we can collectively mitigate the detrimental effects of waste on our planet. By taking small steps now, we can create a sustainable future for future generations.

## The proposed solution
The team agreed to address this problem through a mobile application through which factories can sell their waste instead of burning it. The application doesnâ€™t only allow factories to do so, but also for everyone who has a large amount of waste that can be used and recycled again. 

## Why the solution was chosen?
Today everyone has a mobile, so it will be easy to get this application. Also, users deal with similar applications during their day, such as buying and selling applications, so it will be easy for them to use the application.
